## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a model that helps homeowners and real estate agencies highlight the key components to add profitability when selling their homes. Using multiple linear regression, we will analyze data from the King County House Sales dataset and examine how renovating different components of a hoke will impact overall sales.

## Business Problem

A real estate agency has asked for help regarding how they can increase profitability in selling their homes. Using data from the King County House Sales dataset, we will examine different components of the home, and how renovating them will change the overall price of the home. Due to fluctuations in the housing market, this information is useful for homeowners and real estate agencies in order to maximize their home sales profits.
