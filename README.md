# Seasonal Flu Vaccine Analysis

**Author**: [Michael Tsypin](email:mtsypin9@yahoo.com)

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a model that helps a pharmaceutical company highlight the key factors of people's reasoning behind receiving the seasonal flu vaccine. Using predictive models, we will analyze data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survery dataset and examine which factors are more likely to lead a person to receive the seasonal flu vaccine.

## Business Problem

A pharmaceutical company wants to understand the driving factors for consumers when developing a new flu vaccine. The key components the pharmaceutical company wants to touch on are people's backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors regarding the likelihood of them receiving the vaccine. Using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, we can predict who is most likely to receive the vaccine based on these driving factors.

## Evaluation

Consumers who believed they were at a higher risk of contracting the flu received the seasonal flu vaccine more compared to those thinking they were at a lower risk.

Consumers who had the seasonal flu vaccine recommended to them by their doctor received the vaccine more than those who were not recommended by their doctors.

Consumers who strongly believed the seasonal flu vaccine was effective received the vaccine more than those that had less belief in the vaccine's effectiveness.
