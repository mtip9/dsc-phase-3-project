**Author**: [Michael Tsypin](email:mtsypin9@yahoo.com)

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a model that helps a pharmaceutical company highlight the key factors of people's reasoning behind receiving the seasonal flu vaccine. Using predictive models, we will analyze data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survery dataset and examine which factors are more likely to lead a person to receive the seasonal flu vaccine.

## Business Problem

A pharmaceutical company wants to understand the driving factors for consumers when developing a new flu vaccine. The key components the pharmaceutical company wants to touch on are people's backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors regarding the likelihood of them receiving the vaccine. Using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, we can predict who is most likely to receive the vaccine based on these driving factors.
