**Author**: [Michael Tsypin](email:mtsypin9@yahoo.com)

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a model that helps a pharmaceutical company highlight the key factors of people's reasoning behind receiving the seasonal flu vaccine. Using predictive models, we will analyze data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survery dataset and examine which factors are more likely to lead a person to receive the seasonal flu vaccine.

## Business Problem

A real estate agency has asked for help regarding how they can increase profitability in selling their homes. Using data from the King County House Sales dataset, we will examine different components of the home, and how renovating them will change the overall price of the home. Due to fluctuations in the housing market, this information is useful for homeowners and real estate agencies in order to maximize their home sales profits.
